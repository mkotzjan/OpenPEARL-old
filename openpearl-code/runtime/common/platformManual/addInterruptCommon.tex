\section{How to Create an Interrupt Source}
Interrupt sources are always plattform specific.
In order to create such an interrupt source follow the instructions below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item choose a good name for the interrupt source
\item define the parameters if required
\item create a class with the same name as the your interrupt 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item  derive your class from Interrupt  
  \item supply a constructor which fits to the required parameters
  \item make shure that there is may only one object become created
        by the user
  \item do all required operations, which are required to gather 
        the interrupt afterwards (register in the system, create 
        worker thread, ...)
  \end{enumerate}
\item make shure to call the method \verb|trigger()| from the parent
      class each time the interrupt in detected.
\item add the documentation of your interrupt in the plattform specific part
      of the OpenPEARL documentation
\end{enumerate}
